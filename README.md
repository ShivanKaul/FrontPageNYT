FrontPageNewTab
========
Replace your new tab with a page that displays the latest science news displayed using the New York Times API. 

 Chrome Extension port of [frontpageof.science](http://frontpageof.science). 
 
 Developer's Note:
 =========
 - Please use your own API KEY to send requests. I use a .secret.json file that I don't commit as a config file, which is referenced in extension/src/index.html and then read in extension/src/js/headline.js. It's not a big deal, but whatever.
