========
Replace your new tab with a page that displays the latest news displayed using the New York Times API.

### Paywall

A simple hack around the paywall is to use an Incognito Tab to open the story. Copy URL of the story you're being prevented from seeing, press Cmd (or Control) + Shift + N to open a new Incognito window, paste in the URL and Enter.
