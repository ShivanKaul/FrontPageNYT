FrontPageNYT
========
Replace your new tab with a page that displays the latest news displayed using the New York Times API. Get it as a Chrome Extension on [the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frontpage/mecpnjldoigkgcbheogilceibaeiehnh).

## Developing
You will need to get your own New York Times API key - it should work on https://api.nytimes.com/svc/news/v3/content/all/. Once you have your API key, put it into `extension/src/js/secret.json.sample` and rename `secret.json.sample` to `secret.json`.
